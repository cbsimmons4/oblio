Oblio

Oblio is a web app that can guess what 4 digit number the user is thinking based on information given after each guess. After each guess, the user provides how many digits are in the correct location in the guess and how many digits are in the guess but in the incorrect location. There is also the option for the app to pick the number, then the user guesses what number the app has picked. This app was build with React, react-redux, and material-ui.

*Note: It could take a minute to load the app the first time. It's deployed using Heroku's free tier plan, which causes the server to sleep when not in use.*
